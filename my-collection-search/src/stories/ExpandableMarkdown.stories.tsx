const shortNote = '"Cumbia 73" brings vintage electric guitar and tight rhythm—solid mid-set pick.';

const longNote = `"Cumbia Pop" by Los Beltons is a vibrant, guitar-forward chicha track—fuzzed riffs, bouncy percussion, and melodic hooks. Use it early-mid set to inject upbeat energy and modern nostalgia. Its surf-influenced undercurrent fits well transitioning into tropical funk or nu-chicha cuts.

The guitar tone in particular is distinctive: heavily fuzzed but melodic. Good for segueing from raw funk or salsa-inflected cuts to give the floor a tasteful retro vibe.`;

const markdownNote = `**"Baila Mi Cumbia"** by Carlos Pickling y Su Orquesta is concise and hook-heavy.

- Closes or restarts sets with upbeat momentum
- Perfect for encore transitions
- BPM: 97 — pairs well with 95–100 BPM tracks

> Use a strong fade or drop to link into the next segment.`;
