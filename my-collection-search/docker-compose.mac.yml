# Docker Compose override for macOS
# Disables MPD since macOS doesn't have /dev/snd and audio passthrough works differently
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mac.yml up

services:
  # Disable MPD on macOS (no /dev/snd support)
  mpd:
    profiles:
      - disabled  # Setting a profile that won't be activated disables this service
    deploy:
      replicas: 0  # Alternative way to disable the service
