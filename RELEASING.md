# Releasing GrooveNet

Releases are driven by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). You never tag
by hand — merging a "Release PR" cuts the version, and CI publishes the images.

## The flow

```
Conventional commits land on main
        │
        ▼
release-please opens/updates a "Release PR"   (bumps version + CHANGELOG.md)
        │   ← review the version + changelog; this is the "production-worthy" gate
        ▼
merge the Release PR
        │
        ▼
release-please creates tag vX.Y.Z + GitHub Release
        │
        ▼
docker-publish.yml builds & pushes ghcr.io/public-vinyl-radio/*:vX.Y.Z (+ :latest)
        │
        ▼
deploy: pin IMAGE_TAG=vX.Y.Z on the homelab box and pull (see below)
```

## How the version is decided

Commit / PR title prefix → bump (repo is pre-1.0, so bumps are conservative):

| Prefix | Example | Bump (pre-1.0) |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `fix:` | `fix: correct BPM parsing` | patch (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) |
| `feat:` | `feat: add about page` | patch (pre-1.0) |
| `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` | `feat!: drop v1 API` | minor (pre-1.0) |
| `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `ci:`, … | — | no release |

Because PRs are **squash-merged**, the **PR title** is the commit message that
release-please reads. The `PR Title` check enforces a valid prefix.

### Going 1.0 (or forcing a version)
Add a footer to any commit / the Release PR:

```
Release-As: 1.0.0
```

## One-time setup

1. **`RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` secret** — release-please must create the tag with a
   PAT, not the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` (tags made with `GITHUB_TOKEN` do **not**
   trigger `docker-publish.yml`). Create a fine-grained PAT scoped to this repo
   with **Contents: read/write** and **Pull requests: read/write**, and save it
   as the `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` repository secret.
2. **Squash merge** — enable "Allow squash merging" and set the default squash
   commit message to **"Pull request title"** in the repo settings.

## Deploying a release (homelab)

Images are published to GHCR; deploy is always a local pull on the box (nothing
in CI touches your homelab). The convenient path:

```bash
just deploy v1.2.0        # pulls ghcr images for that tag, migrates, and restarts
```

Or manually on the box:

```bash
# pin the release you want
echo "IMAGE_TAG=v1.2.0" >> .env

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm migrate
```

Rollback = `just deploy v1.1.0` (the previous tag). Images are immutable, so
rollback is exact.

> `just release` no longer tags/builds/deploys in one shot — releases are cut by
> release-please. The `release-localbuild-*` recipes remain as an escape hatch
> for building + deploying locally (e.g. bypassing the registry) and still use
> timestamp tags, which is fine for non-registry local builds.
